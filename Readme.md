The scripts focused on the newspapers data on the **sections** level. The scripts are better commented and contain mostly the same steps as in the earlier *scr* folder.  
  
**scr** and **data** contains scripts and resulting data for the work done with the same dataset as above. The texts were retrieved on the **page** level. Most part of this work was exploratory and done by summer 2022.
